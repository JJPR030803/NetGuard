"""
Machine Learning package for the Network Security Suite.

This package contains machine learning models and algorithms used for threat detection,
anomaly detection, and traffic analysis in the Network Security Suite. It provides
both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to identify potential security threats.

Components:
    - Anomaly detection models for identifying unusual network behavior
    - Classification models for categorizing network traffic and threats
    - Feature extraction utilities for processing network data
    - Model training and evaluation tools
    - Prediction and inference modules

The ML package works closely with the sniffer and core packages to analyze network traffic
patterns and identify potential security threats based on learned patterns and heuristics.
