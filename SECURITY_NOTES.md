# Security Vulnerability Remediation

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and addressed in the project.

### 1. Vulnerabilities in `python-jose` (version 3.5.0)

- **CVE-2024-33664**: Affected versions of Python-jose allow attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) during a decode via a crafted JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio, aka a "JWT bomb."
- **CVE-2024-33663**: Affected versions of Python-jose have an algorithm confusion vulnerability with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.

### 2. Vulnerabilities in `ecdsa` (version 0.19.1)

- **CVE-2024-23342**: The python-ecdsa library is vulnerable to the Minerva attack. This vulnerability arises because scalar multiplication is not performed in constant time, affecting ECDSA signatures, key generation, and ECDH operations.
- **PVE-2024-64396**: Ecdsa does not protect against side-channel attacks. This is because Python does not provide side-channel secure primitives, making side-channel secure programming impossible.

## Remediation Steps

After analyzing the codebase, it was determined that neither `python-jose` nor `ecdsa` were being actively used in the project. These dependencies were likely added in anticipation of future features but were not currently being utilized.

The following steps were taken to address the vulnerabilities:

1. Removed `python-jose` from the project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
2. Updated the `poetry.lock` file to reflect the dependency changes
3. Manually uninstalled `python-jose` and `ecdsa` from the virtual environment
4. Updated the security check command in the `Makefile` to use `pip freeze | safety check --stdin` for more accurate vulnerability scanning
5. Verified that the security checks now pass without detecting the vulnerabilities

## Future Considerations

If JWT-based authentication or other features requiring these libraries are needed in the future, consider the following alternatives:

1. For JWT handling, consider using `authlib` or `pyjwt` which have better security track records
2. For cryptographic operations, consider using `cryptography` directly instead of `ecdsa`

Always ensure that any cryptographic libraries used in the project are regularly updated and checked for security vulnerabilities.
