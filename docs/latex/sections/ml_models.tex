\subsection{Machine Learning Overview}
The Network Security Suite incorporates machine learning capabilities to enhance threat detection beyond traditional rule-based approaches. The ML subsystem is designed to identify anomalous network behavior and classify known attack patterns, providing an additional layer of security.

\subsection{ML Architecture}
The machine learning subsystem consists of several components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing}: Transforms raw packet data into feature vectors suitable for ML algorithms
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Extracts relevant features from network traffic
    \item \textbf{Model Training}: Trains ML models on historical data
    \item \textbf{Inference Engine}: Applies trained models to new data for prediction
    \item \textbf{Model Management}: Handles model versioning, storage, and deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
The effectiveness of machine learning models depends heavily on the quality of features extracted from network traffic. The Network Security Suite extracts the following types of features:

\subsubsection{Packet-Level Features}
Features extracted from individual packets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
    \item Packet size
    \item Header fields (flags, options, etc.)
    \item Time-to-live (TTL)
    \item Fragmentation information
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flow-Level Features}
Features extracted from network flows (sequences of packets between the same source and destination):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Flow duration
    \item Packet count
    \item Bytes transferred
    \item Packet size statistics (mean, variance, etc.)
    \item Inter-arrival time statistics
    \item TCP flags distribution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time-Based Features}
Features that capture temporal patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Traffic volume over time
    \item Connection rate
    \item Periodic behavior patterns
    \item Time-of-day patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Host-Based Features}
Features related to specific hosts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Connection count
    \item Port usage diversity
    \item Failed connection attempts
    \item Service access patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine Learning Models}
The Network Security Suite employs several types of machine learning models for different tasks:

\subsubsection{Anomaly Detection Models}
These models identify unusual network behavior that may indicate security threats:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Isolation Forest}: An ensemble method that explicitly isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.
    
    \item \textbf{One-Class SVM}: A support vector machine variant that learns a boundary around normal data points and classifies points outside this boundary as anomalies.
    
    \item \textbf{Local Outlier Factor (LOF)}: A density-based algorithm that compares the local density of a point with the local densities of its neighbors to identify regions of similar density and points that have substantially lower density than their neighbors.
    
    \item \textbf{Autoencoder}: A neural network architecture that learns to compress and reconstruct normal data. Anomalies are identified by high reconstruction error.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Isolation Forest Implementation]
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, contamination=0.01):
        self.model = IsolationForest(
            n_estimators=100,
            max_samples='auto',
            contamination=contamination,
            random_state=42
        )
        
    def train(self, X):
        """Train the anomaly detection model."""
        self.model.fit(X)
        
    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict anomalies.
        Returns 1 for normal points and -1 for anomalies.
        """
        return self.model.predict(X)
        
    def anomaly_score(self, X):
        """
        Calculate anomaly scores.
        Higher score (closer to 0) indicates more anomalous.
        """
        raw_scores = self.model.decision_function(X)
        # Convert to range [0, 1] where 1 is most anomalous
        return 1 - (raw_scores - np.min(raw_scores)) / (np.max(raw_scores) - np.min(raw_scores))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Classification Models}
These models classify network traffic into known categories, including specific attack types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Forest}: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
    
    \item \textbf{Gradient Boosting}: A machine learning technique that produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
    
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Deep Neural Network}: A neural network with multiple hidden layers that can learn complex patterns in the data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Random Forest Classifier Implementation]
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

class AttackClassifier:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier(
            n_estimators=n_estimators,
            max_depth=None,
            min_samples_split=2,
            random_state=42
        )
        
    def train(self, X, y):
        """Train the classification model."""
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        
    def predict(self, X):
        """Predict attack classes."""
        return self.model.predict(X)
        
    def predict_proba(self, X):
        """Predict class probabilities."""
        return self.model.predict_proba(X)
        
    def evaluate(self, X_test, y_test):
        """Evaluate model performance."""
        y_pred = self.predict(X_test)
        return classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Clustering Models}
These models group similar network traffic patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-Means}: A clustering algorithm that partitions observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
    
    \item \textbf{DBSCAN}: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Clustering}: A method that builds nested clusters by merging or splitting them successively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Training}

def train_model(X, y, model_type='random_forest'):
    # Split data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Create preprocessing and model pipeline
    if model_type == 'random_forest':
        pipeline = Pipeline([
            ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
            ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42))
        ])
        
        # Define hyperparameter grid
        param_grid = {
            'classifier__n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
            'classifier__max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
            'classifier__min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
        }
    
    # Perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(
        pipeline, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='f1_weighted'
    )
    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Get best model
    best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
    
    # Evaluate on test set
    y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
    
    return best_model, report
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Model Serialization]
import joblib

def save_model(model, model_path):
    """Save model to disk."""
    joblib.dump(model, model_path)
    
def load_model(model_path):
    """Load model from disk."""
    return joblib.load(model_path)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Model Versioning}
The system maintains multiple versions of each model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Current production model
    \item Previous production models
    \item Candidate models for evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Serving}
Models are served through the inference engine, which:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Loads the current production model
    \item Preprocesses incoming data
    \item Applies the model to generate predictions
    \item Returns prediction results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous Learning}
The machine learning subsystem implements continuous learning to adapt to evolving network patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic Retraining}: Models are retrained periodically with new data
    \item \textbf{Feedback Loop}: Analyst feedback on false positives/negatives is incorporated into training
    \item \textbf{Concept Drift Detection}: The system monitors for changes in data distribution that may affect model performance
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Thresholds}: Anomaly detection thresholds are adjusted based on current network conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explainability}
