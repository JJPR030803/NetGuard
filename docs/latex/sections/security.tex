\subsection{Security Overview}
Security is a fundamental aspect of the Network Security Suite, both as a security tool itself and as a system that must be secured against potential threats. This section outlines the security considerations, best practices, and measures implemented in the system.

\subsection{Secure Development Practices}
The Network Security Suite follows secure development practices throughout its lifecycle:

\subsubsection{Secure Coding Standards}
The development team adheres to secure coding standards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Input validation for all user-supplied data
    \item Output encoding to prevent injection attacks
    \item Proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
    \item Secure defaults for all configurations
    \item Principle of least privilege in code design
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Testing}
Security testing is integrated into the development process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using tools like Bandit
    \item Software Composition Analysis (SCA) using Safety to check dependencies
    \item Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using tools like OWASP ZAP
    \item Regular security code reviews
    \item Penetration testing before major releases
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Security Testing Commands]
# Static Analysis with Bandit
poetry run bandit -r src/

# Dependency Vulnerability Check with Safety
poetry run safety check

# Run security-focused tests
poetry run pytest tests/security/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Dependency Management}
Dependencies are managed securely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular updates of dependencies to include security patches
    \item Pinned dependency versions in \texttt{poetry.lock}
    \item Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
    \item Dependency vendoring for critical components when necessary
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authentication and Authorization}
The Network Security Suite implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms:

\subsubsection{Authentication}
User authentication is implemented using industry best practices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Password-based authentication with strong password policies
    \item Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    \item JWT-based token authentication for API access
    \item Secure password storage using bcrypt with appropriate work factors
    \item Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption=Password Hashing Example]
from passlib.context import CryptContext

# Configure password hashing
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):
    """Verify a password against a hash."""
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

def get_password_hash(password):
    """Generate a password hash."""
    return pwd_context.hash(password)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Authorization}
Access control is implemented using a role-based approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all system functions
    \item Predefined roles with different permission levels
    \item Fine-grained permissions for specific actions
    \item Authorization checks at both API and service layers
    \item Audit logging of all access control decisions
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption=Authorization Check Example]
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from network_security_suite.auth.permissions import has_permission

async def check_admin_permission(
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
):
    """Check if the current user has admin permissions."""
    if not has_permission(current_user, "admin"):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Insufficient permissions",
        )
    return current_user

@router.post("/users/", response_model=UserResponse)
async def create_user(
    user_create: UserCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(check_admin_permission),
):
    """Create a new user (admin only)."""
    # Implementation...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Data Protection}
The Network Security Suite implements measures to protect sensitive data:

\subsubsection{Data Encryption}
Encryption is used to protect data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item TLS/SSL for all network communications
    \item Database encryption for sensitive data at rest
    \item Encryption of configuration files containing secrets
    \item Secure key management for encryption keys
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Minimization}
The system follows data minimization principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collection of only necessary data
    \item Configurable data retention policies
    \item Automatic data anonymization where appropriate
    \item Secure data deletion when no longer needed
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sensitive Data Handling}
Special care is taken when handling sensitive data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification and classification of sensitive data
    \item Strict access controls for sensitive data
    \item Masking of sensitive data in logs and UI
    \item Secure transmission and storage of credentials
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption=Sensitive Data Masking Example]
def mask_sensitive_data(data, sensitive_fields=None):
    """
    Mask sensitive fields in data for logging or display.
    
    Args:
        data: Dictionary containing data to mask
        sensitive_fields: List of field names to mask
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with sensitive fields masked
    """
    if sensitive_fields is None:
        sensitive_fields = ["password", "token", "secret", "key", "credential"]
        
    masked_data = data.copy()
    
    for field in sensitive_fields:
        if field in masked_data and masked_data[field]:
            masked_data[field] = "********"
            
    return masked_data
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Network Security}
As a network security tool, the Network Security Suite implements robust network security measures:

All network communications are secured:

\begin{itemize}
    \item TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
    \item Certificate validation for all TLS connections
    \item Strong cipher suites and secure protocol configurations
    \item HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Network Isolation}
The system is designed to operate in isolated network environments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for network segmentation
    \item Minimal network dependencies
    \item Configurable network access controls
    \item Operation in air-gapped environments
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Firewall Configuration}
Recommended firewall configurations are provided:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Firewall Configuration Example]
# Allow API access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT

# Allow dashboard access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT

# Allow outgoing connections
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

# Default deny for incoming connections
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
\end{lstlisting}

        self.logger = logging.getLogger("secure_logger")
        self.logger.setLevel(log_level)
        
        handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
        handler.setFormatter(formatter)
        
        self.logger.addHandler(handler)
        
    def log_event(self, event_type, user_id, action, status, details=None):
        """Log a security event with standardized format."""
        log_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "event_type": event_type,
            "user_id": user_id,
            "action": action,
            "status": status,
            "details": details or {}
        }
        
        # Mask any sensitive data in details
        if "details" in log_entry and log_entry["details"]:
            log_entry["details"] = mask_sensitive_data(log_entry["details"])
