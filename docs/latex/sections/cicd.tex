This section provides a comprehensive overview of the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tools and configuration files used in the Network Security Suite project. These tools automate testing, code quality checks, building, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery.

\subsection{Build and Dependency Management}

\subsubsection{pyproject.toml}
The \texttt{pyproject.toml} file is the central configuration file for the Python project, following PEP 518 standards. It serves multiple purposes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Metadata}: Defines the project name, version, description, and author information.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Management}: Specifies all project dependencies using Poetry, separated into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Production dependencies (scapy, fastapi, uvicorn, etc.)
        \item Development dependencies (pytest, black, mypy, etc.)
        \item Test-specific dependencies (pytest-mock, factory-boy, etc.)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tool Configuration}: Contains settings for various development tools:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Black (code formatter) - enforces consistent code style with 88 character line length
        \item isort (import sorter) - organizes imports according to PEP 8
        \item MyPy (type checker) - enforces strict type checking
        \item Pylint (linter) - enforces code quality standards
        \item Pytest (testing framework) - configures test discovery and execution
        \item Coverage (code coverage tool) - measures test coverage
        \item Bandit (security linter) - identifies security vulnerabilities
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{poetry.lock}
The \texttt{poetry.lock} file is automatically generated by Poetry and locks all dependencies to specific versions, ensuring reproducible builds across different environments. This file should be committed to version control to guarantee that all developers and CI/CD pipelines use identical dependencies.

\subsection{Automation and Workflow}

\subsubsection{Makefile}
The \texttt{Makefile} provides a unified interface for common development tasks, abstracting the underlying commands:

\begin{itemize}

        \item \texttt{make install} - Installs production dependencies
        \item \texttt{make dev-install} - Installs all dependencies including development
        \item \texttt{make setup} - Performs complete project setup
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Testing}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{make test} - Runs all tests with coverage reporting
        \item \texttt{make test-unit} - Runs only unit tests
        \item \texttt{make test-integration} - Runs only integration tests

        \item Creates a lightweight image with only runtime dependencies
        \item Copies the virtual environment from the builder stage
        \item Configures a non-root user for security
        \item Sets up health checks for container monitoring
        \item Defines the command to run the application
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Application Service (app)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Builds from the Dockerfile using the development target
        \item Maps port 8000 for API access
        \item Mounts the local directory for live code changes
        \item Sets environment variables for development

\subsection{Conclusion}
The CI/CD tools and configuration files in the Network Security Suite project create a comprehensive automation pipeline that ensures code quality, facilitates testing, and streamlines deployment. This infrastructure enables developers to focus on implementing features while maintaining high standards of code quality and reliability.
