# Security Notes

## Current Vulnerabilities

As of June 4, 2025, the following vulnerabilities remain in the project's dependencies:

### ecdsa (0.19.1)
1. **CVE-2024-23342 (Minerva attack)**
   - Description: The python-ecdsa library is vulnerable to the Minerva attack, which affects ECDSA signatures, key generation, and ECDH operations.
   - Impact: A sophisticated attacker could potentially reconstruct private keys.
   - Mitigation: Currently no fix available from the maintainers.

2. **PVE-2024-64396 (Side-channel attacks)**
   - Description: ecdsa does not protect against side-channel attacks because Python does not provide side-channel secure primitives.
   - Impact: A sophisticated attacker observing just one operation with a private key could potentially reconstruct the private key.
   - Mitigation: Currently no fix available from the maintainers.

### python-jose (3.5.0)
1. **CVE-2024-33664 (JWT bomb)**
   - Description: Python-jose allows attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) during a decode via a crafted JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with a high compression ratio.
   - Impact: Potential denial of service.
   - Mitigation: Currently no fix available from the maintainers.

2. **CVE-2024-33663 (Algorithm confusion)**
   - Description: Python-jose has an algorithm confusion vulnerability with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.
   - Impact: Potential security bypass.
   - Mitigation: Currently no fix available from the maintainers.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities have been fixed by updating dependencies:

1. **anyio (3.7.1 -> 4.9.0)**
   - Fixed thread race condition in `_eventloop.get_asynclib()` (PVE-2024-71199)

2. **black (23.12.1 -> 24.10.0)**
   - Fixed ReDoS vulnerability in the `lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded` function (CVE-2024-21503)

3. **python-multipart (0.0.6 -> 0.0.18)**
   - Fixed ReDoS vulnerability triggered by custom Content-Type headers (PVE-2024-99762)
   - Fixed resource allocation vulnerability (CVE-2024-53981)

4. **starlette (0.27.0 -> 0.46.2)**
   - Fixed DoS vulnerability due to lack of restrictions on multipart part sizes (CVE-2024-47874)

## Future Mitigation Plan

1. **For ecdsa and python-jose vulnerabilities:**
   - Short-term: Monitor for updates from the maintainers.
   - Medium-term: Evaluate alternative libraries like PyJWT or authlib.
   - Long-term: Consider implementing a more secure authentication mechanism that doesn't rely on these vulnerable libraries.

2. **General security improvements:**
   - Implement regular dependency scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Set up automated alerts for new vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - Conduct regular security reviews of the codebase.
