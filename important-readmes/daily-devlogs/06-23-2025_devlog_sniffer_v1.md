# Core sniffer module finished 
Starting on performance metrics inside utils module then starting ml and data processing section of project 
quite excited :) 


## Final thoughts on sniffer
I think i did a good job on it, it being my first attempt at a production ready network sniffer
somewhat messy, and maybe some unnecesary code snippets but still i think i did a good job.
